# Snowflake
ES6 version of @shiffman's Brownian Tree Snowflake. This runs off of a forked
version of P5 to support class extension in P5 with ES6. Plus as many other ES6
goodies I could throw in.

Demo [here](https://uploads.mattstone.io/snowflake/)


## How to run
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
